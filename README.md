# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Project description

This project serves as a Web-App for the new Caf√© at the Udacity campus.
Here everyone can check which drinks are currently on the menu and there is the possibility for managers and baristas to get access to the recipes (managers can edit the menu).
We have three roles: 
1. common visitors without any authentication - those can only see the drinks on the menu
2. baristas (authenticated via Auth0) - they can see rough and detailed recipes for the drinks
3. managers (also authenticated via Auth0) - they can add new drinks, change existing ones and drop drinks from the menu

## Run the project on your local machine

To set everything up you need your Flask-Backend and Angular-Frontend to be running.
How that is done is described in the respective Readmes:

1. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)
2. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)

## Endpoints

### DRINKS

#### GET-Endpoint

The GET drinks endpoint serves to get all drinks without details and is accessible with simple get request without any authentication to: http://localhost:5000/drinks
There are no inputs necessary. It responds with a JSON-object containing a successstatus flag and an array containing all drink objects from the database:

```JSON
{
    "drinks": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "recipe": [
                {
                    "color": "blue",
                    "parts": 1
                }
            ],
            "title": "Water3"
        }
    ],
    "success": true
}
```

The POST drink endpoint serves to create a new drink and is only accessible for manager roles and needs to be accessed with a post request to: http://localhost:5000/drinks 
The header must contain a JWT Bearer token in the "Authorization" field of the header. Also there needs to be a JSON object in the body containing the title of the drink as a string and the recipe as an array of content objects:

```JSON

The response for a successful entry will contain a successflag as well as the object of the added drink:

```JSON
{

                "parts": 1
            }
        ],

    },
    "success": true
}
```

The PATCH drink endpoint serves to update the name or recipe of a drink and is only accessible for manager roles and needs to be accessed with a patch request to: http://localhost:5000/drinks/<id> where <id> is the id of the drink that shall be updated.
The header must contain a JWT Bearer token in the "Authorization" field of the header. Also there needs to be a JSON object in the body containing the title the recipe of the drink as a string and/or the recipe as an array of content objects:

```JSON
{
    "drinks": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "recipe": [
                {
                    "color": "blue",
                    "name": "water",
                    "parts": 1
                }
            ],

        }
    ],
    "success": true
}
```
